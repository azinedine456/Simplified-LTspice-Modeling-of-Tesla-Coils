# Spark Gap Tesla Coil – Modeling and Simulation

This repository contains a **personal project** focused on understanding, modeling, and simulating **spark gap Tesla coils**.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Understand the operation** and underlying physics of a spark gap Tesla coil.  
- **Use behavioral components in LTspice** to simulate circuit dynamics and resonant behavior.  
- **Develop a simplified model** based on the methodology described in **Mitch Tilbury’s _“The Ultimate Tesla Coil Design and Construction Guide”_**.

---

##  Tools & Environment

- **Simulation Software:** LTspice  
- **Modeling Focus:** Resonant circuits, spark gap behavior, energy transfer efficiency
